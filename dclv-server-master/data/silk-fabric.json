A special fabric woven in a satin self-stripe, alternating between a looser and tighter weave creating a very subtle seersucker look on the reverse, and a hammered satin on the face. The design is printed by experts in Italy onto the subtly textured 16 momme silk satin â€“ a fabric prized for its lustrous drape and fluidity, along with its colour luminously. Construct it into special occasion pieces such as gowns, or use it to create opulently wearable daytime designs like wrap dresses and flowing shirting. Add flair to suiting and outerwear and use it as a luxurious statement lining option. Choose this stunning fabric for accessories like scarves, scrunchies and ties for a hint of pattern and colour.",

This incredible large-scale digital print is made up of flourishing passionflower, trumpet flower, poppy, lilly and orchid flowers. Tones of guava, teal, mint, beige, cream, red and periwinkle pop on the solid black base. A special fabric woven in a satin self-stripe, alternating between a looser and tighter weave creating a very subtle seersucker look on the reverse, and a hammered satin on the face. The design is printed by experts in Italy onto the subtly textured 16 momme silk satin â€“ a fabric prized for its lustrous drape and fluidity, along with its colour luminously. Construct it into special occasion pieces such as gowns, or use it to create opulently wearable daytime designs like wrap dresses and flowing shirting. Add flair to suiting and outerwear and use it as a luxurious statement lining option. Choose this stunning fabric for accessories like scarves, scrunchies and ties for a hint of pattern and colour.",
