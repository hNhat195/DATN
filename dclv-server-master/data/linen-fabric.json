This midweight fabric has a lovely earthy feel, with subtle, naturally occurring slubs throughout. This non-stretch fabric is great for a wide variety of projects including tops, dresses, loose-fitting skirts, shorts, trousers & jumpsuits as well as some lightweight soft furnishings.\n\nVintage Finish Linens feature a uniquely ‘worn-in’ look and super soft handle. This finish is achieved through careful selection of Belgian-origin flax fibres, a specialized spinning process and a cold-pad batch dyeing system, certified to OEKO-TEX Standard 100. #tfsvflinen\n\nPlease note, due to the natural variation in flax yarn this fabric may have subtle colour variance on some threads throughout. This is a characteristic of the fabric and is not deemed as a flaw.\n",
